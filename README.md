# Image-classifier-for-fruits
simple machine learning project to classify synthetic fruit images (apple, banana, orange) using **color-based features** and a **Random Forest** classifier.
No deep learning or TensorFlow required!

## How It Works

- Synthetic color data is generated to simulate fruit characteristics.
- Color features are extracted (RGB, brightness, contrast, color ratios).
- A RandomForest classifier is trained on these features.
- Synthetic fruit images are created and tested on the trained model.
